    <h1> What is Blockchain</h1>
    <pre>10/12/24

        I've installed:
        - python
        - py-algorand-sdk
        - pyteal
        
        for gas fees, I need Test algo
        https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/
        
        so day1, I created and deployed a simple html website
        day2 is about learning how to write a smart contract and deploy it!
        
        i got stuck. so i left it and went to the documentation!
        https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/what_is_blockchain/
        
        last time I heard of a ledger was in befa class. In the blockchain ledger, transactional data is connected to web3? and not just few databases.
        
        each transaction is approved by a node, and then added to the ledger (record). chain = linkedlist of cryptographic hash, change in 1 node also can reject the process.
        
        Each node runs software that instructs them how to verify transactions and add new blocks to the chain. These instructions are collectively referred to as the “consensus protocol”
        
        Blockchain, at its core, is a technology that innovates on how we transfer value.</pre>
