    <h1>Day 2: What is Blockchain?</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Installed Tools</h2>
        <p>Today, I installed the following tools to begin exploring blockchain development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>py-algorand-sdk</li>
            <li>PyTeal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To handle gas fees, I needed test ALGO tokens, which can be obtained from the <a href="https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/" target="_blank">Algorand TestNet Dispenser</a>.</p>

        <h2>Day 1 Recap</h2>
        <p>On Day 1, I created and deployed a simple HTML website.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Day 2 Goals</h2>
        <p>Today, I focused on learning how to write and deploy a smart contract. However, I encountered some challenges and decided to consult the <a href="https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/what_is_blockchain/" target="_blank">Algorand Developer Documentation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Blockchain, at its core, is a technology that innovates how we transfer value. It operates as a decentralized ledger where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each transaction is approved by a node and added to the ledger as a new record.</li>
            <li>The ledger forms a chain, similar to a linked list, where each block is linked using cryptographic hashes.</li>
            <li>Any change to a node can invalidate the chain, ensuring data integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The term "ledger" reminded me of my Business Economics and Financial Analysis (BEFA) class. Unlike traditional ledgers, blockchain connects transactional data across Web3 rather than a few isolated databases.</p>

        <h2>Consensus Protocol</h2>
        <p>Each node in a blockchain network runs software that provides instructions on how to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify transactions</li>
            <li>Add new blocks to the chain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These instructions are collectively referred to as the “consensus protocol.”</p>
